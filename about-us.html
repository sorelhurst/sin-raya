We invest in companies with big aspirations and the drive to make them come true. We contribute capital, global networks and deep expertise. We help make it happen. Our team is made up of experienced investors who have a deep understanding of various industries and a passion for helping others. We like to invest in small and are committed to helping our portfolio companies succeed. We are performance-driven investors committed to our values. Our investment decisions take no more than one month from our first meeting... no exhausting discussions on valuation or arcane terms. We are disciplined, committed to the long-term and hold ourselves accountable. We seek to be the best in everything we do; we are humble; we are always learning; where others are better than us, we want to work with them. We work hard to earn your trust; we do not want to lose it; we deliver on what we promise; we cherish our reputation and don´t take risks which can hurt it. We want to be your partner of choice; we are accessible; we do not let short-term concerns distract us from our long-term commitments. Finally, we are very deliberate about our social responsibility. We believe that success involves more than just superior financial returns. Businesses that create positive impact in their communities are more resilient and with a stronger license to operate. We consider our social responsibility throughout our investment process. We support management teams to identify businesses with strong ESG track records and work with them to set targets and implement actions that achieve more. As a result, our businesses continually look to improve their community, sustain its economy, create quality employment and manage their environmental footprint responsibly."><meta name="generator" content="Publii Open-Source CMS for Static Site"><link rel="canonical" href="https://sorelhurst.com/sin-raya/about-us.html"><link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="https://sorelhurst.com/sin-raya/feed.xml"><link rel="alternate" type="application/json" href="https://sorelhurst.com/sin-raya/feed.json"><meta property="og:title" content="About Us"><meta property="og:image" content="https://sorelhurst.com/sin-raya/media/posts/1/black-background-bulb-close-up-52910.jpg"><meta property="og:image:width" content="3888"><meta property="og:image:height" content="2592"><meta property="og:site_name" content="SinRaYa"><meta property="og:description" content="We are a private investment office.
